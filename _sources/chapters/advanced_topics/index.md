This section explores cutting-edge techniques and extensions to the basic Bayesian optimization framework that can address complex challenges in molecular discovery.

## What You'll Learn

- Advanced strategies for scaling Bayesian optimization to practical drug discovery scenarios
- Methods for handling specialized constraints and requirements in molecular optimization
- Cutting-edge approaches that push the boundaries of traditional Bayesian optimization

## Chapter Overview

- **Batch Bayesian Optimization**: Learn how to efficiently select multiple molecules to test in parallel, a critical capability for modern high-throughput experimental settings, using techniques such as local penalization, determinantal point processes, and batch acquisition functions.

- **Multi-Fidelity Optimization**: Explore methods for leveraging data from multiple sources with different levels of fidelity, such as combining quick computational predictions with more expensive experimental tests to accelerate optimization.

- **Constrained Optimization**: Master techniques for optimizing molecular properties subject to constraints, such as synthetic accessibility, toxicity limits, or specific structural requirements, using approaches like constrained acquisition functions and feasible region modeling.

By the end of this section, you'll understand advanced techniques that address real-world complexities in drug discovery optimization, enabling you to tackle more challenging and realistic molecular design problems.
