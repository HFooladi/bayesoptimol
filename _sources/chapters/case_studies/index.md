# Case Studies in Molecular Optimization

This section presents real-world applications of Bayesian optimization and active learning in drug discovery through detailed case studies. These examples demonstrate how the theoretical concepts from previous sections translate into practical implementations and results.

## What You'll Learn

- How to apply Bayesian optimization and active learning to real molecular datasets
- Practical considerations when optimizing different molecular properties
- Strategies for handling the challenges that arise in real drug discovery projects

## Chapter Overview

- **Solubility Optimization**: Follow a complete workflow for optimizing molecular solubility, from data preparation and model selection to acquisition function implementation and results analysis.

- **Binding Affinity Prediction**: Explore how to use Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify molecules with high binding affinity to a target protein, including protein-ligand interaction modeling and structure-based approaches.

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Learn strategies for simultaneously optimizing multiple molecular properties, such as potency, selectivity, and ADMET properties, using Pareto-based approaches and scalarization techniques.

By the end of this section, you'll understand how the theoretical concepts covered in earlier chapters can be applied to solve real drug discovery challenges, and you'll have practical templates that you can adapt to your own research projects.
