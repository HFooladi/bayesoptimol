# Foundations of Bayesian Optimization and Active Learning

This section introduces the fundamental concepts and background knowledge needed to understand Bayesian optimization and active learning in the context of drug discovery.

## What You'll Learn

- The theoretical underpinnings of Bayesian optimization and how it differs from other optimization approaches
- Key principles of active learning and how they apply to molecular property optimization
- Different methods for representing molecules and chemical structures for machine learning
- Techniques for representing chemical reactions and transformations

## Chapter Overview

- **Bayesian Optimization Introduction**: Learn the basic principles of Bayesian optimization, including probabilistic modeling, surrogate models, and how to balance exploration and exploitation.

- **Active Learning Introduction**: Understand how active learning strategies can efficiently guide experimental design to maximize information gain with minimal experiments.

- **Molecular Representations**: Explore different techniques for encoding molecular structures into formats suitable for machine learning algorithms, including fingerprints, descriptors, and graph-based representations.

- **Reaction Representations**: Discover methods for representing chemical reactions and transformations to enable machine learning on reaction spaces.

By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of the core concepts that serve as building blocks for the more advanced techniques covered in later chapters.
